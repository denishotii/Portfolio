# Portfolio Project for Starlabs Internship

### Hello.

### Please locate this project inside a server like XAMPP and send it to the - / htdocs / folder. The MySql database file can be found at path = ./database/portfolio.sql , and  configuration to connect with database is done in path = ./config.php  AND ./admin/config.php  - Here you can change the connection parameters!

To go to the Administration section (Admin) after you are at path = / shop / --- add part = admin /
To create an Admin Account go to this path : ./admin/signup/    ---  To login after creating your account you first will need to confirm your email addres, you will get an mail if you cant find it in inbox have a look at SPAM messages.
Or you can use an account to login as Admin which I created for you:    username: admin | password: adminadmin

Thank you very much!
